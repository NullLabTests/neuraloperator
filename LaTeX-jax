Sundered ledger, page three: the market hums at dusk; old men swap riddles about rain. Lattice of cobblestones, a child traces prime-shaped loops: 2,3,5,7—soft arithmetic like breathing. Between vendors a clockwork cat counts phi^2 − phi = 1.618^2 − 1.618 ≈ 0.618, folded into paper boats. Cipher: take n where n ≡ 1 (mod 3) and n maps to cello tones; sum_{k=1}^{m} (-1)^k/(2k+1) approximates whispered arcs. Coordinates: (e^{iπ/7}, ln(23)/ln(5)), a recipe for fog. Keep the key beneath a pressed violet.
